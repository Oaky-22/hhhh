  <h1>History?</h1>
  <div class="line"></div>
  <p>St. Xavier's College was founded on 2 January 1869 in Bombay by German Jesuits with only two students in attendance. The two students came from a group of six, who appeared for the university matriculation examination in 1868 from St. Mary's Institution. Swiss Jesuit Joseph Michael Willi [de; fr] (or Willy), the first principal of the college from 1869 to 1873, and three other Jesuits began lecturing and teaching at the college on 7 January 1869. The college was granted formal recognition by Bombay University on 30 January 1869. One student joined later in 1870. The first three students graduated in 1871.[1][10] From 1884 to 1910, under the patronage of Principal Frederick Dreckmann, the college began to develop rapidly.[11] The Blatter Herbarium was established in 1906 by the Swiss Jesuit priest Ethelbert Blatter and his associates.[12] The hostel was completed in 1909, while the east–west science wing, costing Rs. 200,000, was completed in 1912. The Government provided grants of Rs. 70,000 and Rs. 37,000 for the two additional buildings of the college. The college first admitted women in 1912.[11]</p>
